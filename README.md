# Advanced-GitOps-Techniques

This project focuses on advanced GitOps techniques using ArgoCD, focusing on real-world applications like multi-cluster deployments, microservices architectures, and integrating ArgoCD into CI/CD pipelines.

## Introduction

his module takes learners through advanced GitOps techniques using ArgoCD, focusing on real-world applications like multi-cluster deployments, microservices architectures, and integrating ArgoCD into CI/CD pipelines. By the end of this module, learners will be equipped to handle complex Kubernetes deployments and understand how GitOps principles apply in various scenarios.

## Deploying Multi-Cluster and Microservices Architectures with ArgoCD

### Objective

Develop proficiency in deploying applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and managing complex microservices architectures using ArgoCD.
**Steps**

1. Setting Up Multi-Cluster Environment

- Configuring Multiple Kubernetes Clusters:
  - Set up distinct Kubernetes environments. This could involve creating multiple clusters on AWS EKS for a more realistic production setup, or using minikube for a simplified local development environment.
  - Ensure each cluster is accessible and properly configured (with contexts set up in your `kubeconfig` file).

- Registering Clusters with ArgoCD
  - Use the `argocd` CLI to add each Kubernetes cluster to ArgoCDâ€™s management.
  - Code Snippet: `argocd cluster add CONTEXT_NAME`
  
2. Deploying Applications to Multiple Clusters

- Creating Application Definitions for Each Cluster
  - Define an ArgoCD application in YAML format for deployment in each cluster. These applications can point to the same or different Git repositories depending on your deployment strategy.
  - Customize applications for each cluster by using different namespaces, resource limits, or feature flags.
